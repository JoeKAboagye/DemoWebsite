            <h3>A brief of Nuclear Family</h3>
            <p>As you can see from the image to your left, we are six excluding my nephews. My father is a very busy man
              working outside my country, Ghana. That's reason why he is not in the picture at the time it was taken.
              Okay!, let's dive into the surface about each person.
            </p>
            <p>My father's name is Mr. Sampson Aboagye and my mother is Mrs. Sophia Aboagye <i>(sitting to the left).</i>
            My eldest sister (1st born) is Mrs. Josephine Sagoe-Pyne <i>(sitting to the right)</i> - she is married with
            two children (twin boys) and is a nurse. My elder sister (2nd born) is Mrs.
             Elizabeth Aboagye <i>(to the middle left)</i> - she is married and is an accountant. My third-born sister is
             Mrs. Paulina Ansong <i>(to the middle right)</i> - she is married with a daugther and is a physician assistant.
             My elder brother (4th born) is Mr. Solomon Aboagye <i>(to the far right)</i> - he is married with two boys
             and is a pharmacist. And finally me, Mr. Joseph Aboagye <i>(to the far left)</i> -
             currently, I have a girlfriend (Mary Johnson) and I am teacher with a civil engineering degree.</p>

            <h3>My future aspiration</h3>
            <p>After pursuing a degree in civil engineering, i still felt there was more for me to do. I didn't find it
               as a profession to pursue anymore. I tried the industry for two years but wasn't convinced. 
               After some soul searching, online searches and family and friends enquiries,
               I fell in love with teaching and software engineering. I am currently exploring the teaching field and
               I love what i am doing very much. My future dream is to become a <b> software engineer and teacher</b>.
               I love what <abbr tabindex="0" title=" - Africa Leadership Xcelerator">ALX</abbr> is doing and 
               I am glad to join their programme in achieving my dreams.
               I am getting to work!
            <p>Here is a little about my ambition
             <dl>
             <dt><u>Mission</u></dt>
               <dd> To Impact the issue of waste management by using my education and science and mathematics as a 
                 teacher(educator) and software engineer. I will make sure to achieve this by learning hard so 
                 i can broaden my knowledge</dd>
               <dt><u>Vision</u></dt>
               <dd>
               <ul>
                <li>My longterm vision is to form a company that will tackle the waste and environmental problems of 
                  this world and also design timeless and innovative products for this generation and beyond.</li>
                 <li>My shortterm goal is to undergo rigorous training as a software engineer and finish my fellowship
                    succesfully as a Lead for Ghana cohort.</li></ul></dd>
             </dl>
             <p><abbr tabindex="0" title=" - Lead For Ghana">LFG</abbr> has given me a platform that is shaping 
              my leadership qualities.
